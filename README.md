# BAN6420-Module-4-Assignment-Netflix-Data-Visualization

## Overview:
This project involves the analysis and visualization of Netflix's shows and movies data using Python and R. The dataset includes information on genres, ratings, and more.

### Instructions:

1. **Data Preparation**:  
   The dataset is loaded, renamed, and cleaned. Missing values are removed.
   
2. **Data Cleaning**:  
   Missing values are addressed by dropping any rows with missing data.
   
3. **Data Exploration**:  
   Descriptive statistics for numerical data are provided.
   
4. **Data Visualization**:  
   - Visualize the most-watched genres using plotly to create an interactive bar chart.
   - Visualize the distribution of ratings using plotly to create an interactive histogram.
   
5. **R Integration**
This Shiny application provides an interactive bar plot visualization of the most-watched genres from the Netflix dataset. The visualization is created using the ggplot2 package, allowing users to see the top genres based on frequency. The data is processed and displayed dynamically within the Shiny framework, making it user-friendly and interactive.

### Running the Code:
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Run `Netflix Data Visualiztion.ipynb` to perform data analysis and visualization using Python.
3. Use the provided R code for visualization in RStudio.
